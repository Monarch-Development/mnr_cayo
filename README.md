![mnr_cayo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Monarch-Development/.github/refs/heads/main/release_images/mnr_cayo.png)

After years of missing an updated and optimized resource for the category I present Monarch Cayo, an IPL loader that uses ox_lib functions to load only the IPLs needed for the island of Cayo Perico

## Features
- Loads all required parts of the island one time during player login
- No bloatware, all unnecessary IPLs arenâ€™t loaded
- Water and paths management with ox_lib points
- Custom ymaps: hangar gates and mansion gates and doors openable
- Preset: removed all car generators

## Presets
- [NO CARGEN](https://github.com/Monarch-Development/Monarch-Presets/tree/main/cayo/nocargen)
